## Terms of Reference for Community Advisory Committee 

Thank you for agreeing to be part of the Community Advisory Committee (CAC) for the Sleep Health in Perinatal Care (SHINE) project. This document provides further information about the committee and should be read alongside the [CAC Position Description](https://github.com/beisci/shine-open/blob/main/cac/position-des.md). 

### Contacts 
Your main contact person for this project will be Cornelia Wellecke, the Community Engagement Lead. The Community Engagement Lead manages the daily operations of the CAC and escalates when necessary to the Research Lead. Please contact Cornelia via psych-shine@monash.edu if you have any concerns or queries. 

CAC members may also be interacting with other staff members of the research project, such as: 
- Nina Quin (Clinical Lead)
- Meagan Crowther (Research Lead)
- Laura Astbury (Clinical PhD Candidate)
- Dr Bei Bei (Principal Investigator)


### Time commitments 
The membership is expected to last one year, and may be renewed by mutual agreement between the advisory member and SHINE project. During this period you are being asked to give the following time commitment: 

- Attend approximately 4-6 meetings during the first year of the project (2022-2023), 1-2 meetings in subsequent years as needed (2023 and beyond). Meetings are expected to take 1–1.5 hours each. 
- Familiarise yourself with the agenda and supporting documents prior to meetings. 
- Occasionally provide feedback on written materials of the research project (for example, questionnaires, consent forms, etc).
- Participate in a 1–hour course providing community engagement training.

### Details relating to CAC meetings
Meetings will usually be held virtually via teleconference (e.g., Zoom). We will aim to schedule the time and circulate the agenda with relevant documents at least one week in advance. If you are unable to attend, please let the Community Engagement Lead know as soon as possible.

The committee meetings will consist of approximately 5 members who have lived experience of being a new parent or being a perinatal health professional. The meetings will also be attended by research staff from the SHINE project.

### Support for the role
If you have any specific support needs, please do not hesitate to reach out to the Community Engagement Lead.

### Expenses and payment
During the membership, you will receive the following payments: 
- An honorarium of $50 per hour for attending meetings.
- A one-off payment of $50 for participating in the community engagement training. When you complete the course, please email us the certificate of completion. 

You may also be reimbursed for any additional expenses, such as child care expenses, if necessary to participate in CAC meetings. These expenses should be agreed upon with the Community Engagement Lead in advance.

### Conflict of interest
The University acknowledges that its affiliates engage in a wide variety of activities external to the University and considers that such activities are in the public interest and of benefit both to the University and the individuals involved. These activities may from time to time give rise to conflicts of interests, whether actual, potential, or merely perceived, such as a conflict of interests arising because of your employment with your employer. In keeping with its commitment to high ethical standards, and to protect the reputations of all involved, the University has adopted the [Conflict of Interest Procedure](https://publicpolicydms.monash.edu/Monash/documents/1935671). If, having read the policy, you consider that you have interests that should be declared, please contact the Community Engagement Lead, who will determine whether a conflict declaration or conflict management plan needs to be arranged.

### Confidential information and intellectual property 
The SHINE project will not disclose your personal identifying information (e.g., name, contact details), or any personal information you may disclose during meetings to anyone outside of the project without your permission. To recognise contribution from CAC members, the SHINE project may ask your permission to include your name and photo on the project website; this is optional and you can choose not to be included.

You agree to:
- Not disclose information labeled as confidential to individuals outside of the committee, except when you are required to disclose by law; 
- Only use Confidential Information for the purpose of performing the duties associated with the affiliation. 
- Assign to the SHINE project ownership of any intellectual property created by you in the course of carrying out your CAC membership, so that your input can be incorporated into the research project. You agree you will not publish or otherwise disclose that intellectual property until such publication or disclosure is approved in writing by the Research Team.

### Membership renewal and termination
Memberships are on one-year terms, and can be renewed upon mutual agreement. 

Membership may be terminated before the one-year term if:
- A member no longer wishes to take part in the community advisory committee.
- A member does not contribute sufficiently or appropriately to the project, or breached the terms of the CAC membership. The research team will endeavour to take all other measures (e.g., discussion, conflict resolution) before a termination of membership is considered under these circumstances.
