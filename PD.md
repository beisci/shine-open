### Sleep Health in Perinatal Care (SHINE) ‚≠ê
SHINE is a large collaborative project amongst Monash University (Lead), Stanford University (USA), Monash Health, and the Royal Women's Hospital. It is funded by Australian government (National Health and Medical Research Council) to study changes in sleep and wellbeing across pregnancy and the postpartum years, and to evaluate interventions for improving sleep during this important period for Australian families.

We are seeking consultations and advice from community members with lived experiences of being a new parent as well as health care professionals supporting new parents. These members of the community will form the Community Advisory Committee, and  play important roles throughout this project, including the initial development of the project, how it's carried out, and how findings are disseminated.

### Community Advisory Committee‚Äôs role üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë
The following provides an overview of the tasks involved in the Community Advisory Committee:

**Completing training on consumer and community involvement**

	- the development and design of the intervention

- Meetings will be audio-taped for accurate minute taking. Minutes will only be circulated internally. Minutes will not be used outside of the team unless members approve.
