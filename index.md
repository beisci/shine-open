# SHINE: Sleep Health in Perinatal Care

## What is the SHINE Study investigating?
The SHINE Study follows parents from pregnancy through to their child's 2nd birthday. 

We are investigating how sleep, health and emotions change during the early parenting period. 

We are also investigating two science-based interventions for sleep in birthing parents with sleep troubles

## Who can get involved?
**Are you or your partner currently expecting a baby?**

We are seeking pregnant individuals (less then 32 weeks pregnant) and their parents for participation. You may be eligible if:
* Currently live in Australia
* Have regular internet access
* Are, or your partner is, less than 32 weeks pregnant

## Why is the SHINE Study important?
By understanding changes in sleep and the effectiveness of different programs for sleep health in new parents we can better support parents during this time of big change. Findings from this project will inform how perinatal sleep interventions could be further developed and implemented in perinatal care.
