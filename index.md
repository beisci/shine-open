## What is the SHINE Study investigating?
The SHINE Study follows parents from pregnancy through to their child's 2nd birthday. 

We are investigating how sleep, health and emotions change during the early parenting period. 

We are also investigating two science-based interventions for sleep in birthing parents with sleep troubles

## Who can get involved?

We are seeking pregnant individuals (less then 32 weeks pregnant) and their parents for participation. You may be eligible if:
